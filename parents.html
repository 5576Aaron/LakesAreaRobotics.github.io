          <p>
            Lakes Area Robotics supports two levels of robotics competitions.
            FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a program for high school
            students working with adult mentors to learn design, manufacturing, 
            AD, programming, business and marketing skills.
            FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is a middle school program that introduces students
            to these same concepts, using the familar LEGO systems to compete at regional events.
            Formore information, visit our
            <a href="first.html">About FIRST</a> page. 
            <li>Lakes Area Robotics is a
            non profit organization that was setup to support the Spirit Lake, IA area
            FRC team, #5576 - Team Terminator and FLL Team #60636 Mystical Minds.</li>

          <p>
            The Team Terminator FRC program runs year round and is split into 4
            seasons:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Off-Season (May-Aug): During this time meetings are more sporadic
              and event-based. We focus on outreach events and fundraisers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pre-Season (Sep-Dec): The team meets biweekly to recruit and train
              new FRC members.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build Season (Jan-Mar): This is the most critical time for the
              team. In this two months the competition game is revealed and the
              robot is constructed. Team meetings will be more frequent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Competition Season (Mar-Apr): The team travels for 1-2 regional
              events to hopefully qualify for the world championship.
            </li>
          </p>
            The Mystical Minds LEGO League program starts in the fall semester:
            <ul>
              <li>
              Season Kickoff (August): Game is annouced for the year, and team roster is created
              </li>
              <li>
              Main season practices (September-December) : The team meets once per week to build
               the robot and prepare for the presentation.
            </li>
            <li>
             Competition (Early January ~TENTATIVE): The team travels to a competition in Iowa
              to try and earn a ticket to the state level competition at Iowa State University. 
            </li>

          <h2 class="other-title">SEASON BREAKDOWN</h2>
          <p>
            Both the FRC and FLL games change every year and the kickoff of a new season is
             a virtual event, but we typically get together and watch it as a team. Kickoff is
            also an important day for students to breakdown the rules of the
            game and begin forming their strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the build season, teams meet to design and assembly their robot. As we
            get closer to our competition date, the frequency of meetings
            increases. We also love it when parents donate
            snacks for the team. Coaches and mentors determine what dates work
            best for our schedule. You can always find our practice schedule
            <a href="calendar.html">here</a>.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The FRC team competes in 2 regionals. Regional
            competitions are 3.5 days long, a practice day followed by two days
            of matches. Setup begins Wednesday evening and the competition
            concludes after the play-offs on Saturday afternoon. Parents are 
            encouraged to attend and it is free to the public. Events are also livestreamed.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the 2025 season, our first regional is the TBD
            Regional Date # - Date #. The other regional we are planning to
            compete in is the TBD Date # - Date #.
          </p>
          The FLL team competes at one regional event in Iowa, taking place on a Saturday.
          Events are a single day, consisting of robot matches and the team presentation.
          Events are typcially hosted at high schools, and parents are always welcome to
          cheer on the team!
          <p>
            These competitions are such a great experience where all our hard
            work is put into motion. Competition travel and lodging fees are covered
            by Lakes Area Robotics, if you would like to support your student,
            your contributions are tax deductible.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Register your student in STIMS if you haven't done so already.
              It's required every year and it doesn't carry over from one FIRST
              program to another. You can do this by going to
              <a href="firstinspires.org">firstinspires.org</a> and click on
              register in the top right corner of the website. If you need help,
              go to
              <a
                href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system"
                >this site</a
              >. The high school program is FRC or FIRST Robotics
              Competition, and the team number is 5576. The middel school 
              program is FLL or FIRST LEGO League, and the team number is 60636.
              This is a requirement for students wanting to
              participate in any FIRST competition.
