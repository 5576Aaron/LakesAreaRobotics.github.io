            FIRST Robotics Competition or FRC is a program for high school
            students working with adult mentors to learn about STEM and even
            some other aspects of teamwork and operating a robotics club. For
            more information, visit our
            <a href="first.html">About FIRST</a> page. Iowa City Robotics is a
            non profit organization that was setup to support the Iowa City area
            FRC team, #167 - Children of the Corn.

            The Iowa City FRC program runs year round and is split into 4
            seasons:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Off-Season (May-Aug): During this time meetings are more sporadic
              and event-based. We focus on outreach events, fundraisers, and
              host robot camps for 7-10 year olds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pre-Season (Sep-Dec): The team meets once weekly to recruit and
              train new FRC members
            </li>
            <li>
              Build Season (Jan-Mar): This is the most critical time for the
              team. In this two months the competition game is revealed and the
              robot is constructed. Team meetings will be more frequent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Competition Season (Mar-Apr): The team travels for 1-2 regional
              events to hopefully qualify for the world championship.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="other-title">SEASON BREAKDOWN</h2>
          <p>
            The FRC game changes every year and the kickoff of a new season is
            typically the first full weekend in January. This is a virtual event
            but we typically get together and watch it as a team. Kickoff is
            also an important day for students to breakdown the rules of the
            game and begin forming their strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the build season, we typically meet 3-4 times a week. As we
            get closer to our competition date, the frequency of meetings
            increases. On the weekends we tend to get a couple of pizzas to keep
            the students energy levels high. We also love it when parents donate
            snacks for the team. The mentors are determining what dates work
            best for our schedule. You can always find our practice schedule
            <a href="calendar.html">here</a>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div class="parents-img-group-2">
            <img src="static/img/parents/junior_bots.png" />
            <img src="static/img/parents/student_meeting.png" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            The team typically registers to compete in 2 regionals. Regional
            competitions are 3 days long, a practice day followed by two days of
            matches. The regionals are livestreamed but parents are welcome and
            it is free to the public. For the 2022 season, our first regional is
            in Duluth, Minnesota. We will travel to Duluth on Wednesday March 1,
            Thursday is the practice day and Friday/Saturday is match play and
            the playoffs. We will travel back on Sunday, March 5. The other
            regional we are competing in is the Iowa Regional which is in Cedar
            Falls. That one, we will travel up on Thursday morning, March 22.
            Again, Friday and Saturday is match play and playoffs but we will
            travel back that Saturday evening. If we are fortunate to qualify
            for the World championships, that competition is in Houston on April
            19-22.
          </p>
          <p>
            These competitions are such a great experience where all our hard
            work is put into motion. Although competitions are not required, it
            is encouraged. Once you've been to one, you always want to go back.
            Estimated costs for these competitions are typically $100-$200 per
            student. This will cover transportation and lodging along with our
            competition uniform (polo and t-shirt). If we continue to fundraise,
            some of these costs can be covered.
          </p>
          <h2 class="other-title">WHAT IS NEEDED FROM PARENTS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Register your student in STIMS if you haven't done so already.
              It's required every year and it doesn't carry over from one FIRST
              program to another. If registered for an FTC team, you still need
              to register for our FRC team. You can do this by going to
              <a href="firstinspires.org">firstinspires.org</a> and click on
              register in the top right corner of the website. If you need help,
              go to
              <a
                href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system"
                >this site</a
              >. Our team number is 167 and the program is FRC or FIRST Robotics
              Competition. This is a requirement for students wanting to
              participate in any FIRST competition.

            <li>
              We have a team apparel on-line store where you can purchase our
              team competition polo shirt if your student doesn't have one
              already and a team competition t-shirt that is new every year. We
              also have sweatshirts and a quarter zip available for purchase.
              Team store orders are due December 12. You can visit the store
              <a href="https://icr2022.itemorder.com/shop/closed/">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any help connecting with company sponsors or donors. We have
              raised enough to cover registration fees and some robot material
              costs. We need a lot more if we want to cover student competition
              costs.
