                    FIRST - For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.
                    The FIRST Robotics Competition is an international robotics competition featuring teams from all
                    over the world,
                    including Israel, Brazil, and China.
                    High school students from 9-12 grade compete to build a robot in a six week time constraint.
                    Each year, teams are challenged to “raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and
                    build and program industrial-size robots
                    to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors.”
                    Volunteer mentors guide teams of students to compete in regional competitions and potentially
                    qualify for the international competition in St. Louis, Missouri.

                    “FIRST is more than robots. The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills.
                    Kids often come in not knowing what to expect - of the program nor of themselves.
                    They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future.” - Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST
