                    We, Iowa City Robotics Team 167, need to fundraise $20,000 every year for expenses. A new robot costs starts at around $4,500. We also need around $9,000 for competitions. We have 4 tiers of sponsorship: Green and Yellow, Bronze, Silver, Gold. Green and Yellow sponsorship is obtained by donating under $500. With Green and Yellow Level Sponsorship, one receives a nod in our team brochure and website. Bronze sponsorship is gained by donating from $500 to $999. With Bronze Level Sponsorship, one gets an acknowledgement on the pit banner and on the t-shirts with all the benefits of the level below it. Silver Sponsorship is obtained by donating from $1,000 to $2,499. With Silver Level Sponsorship, one receives a logo on the robot and the reward for the tiers below. One obtains Gold Sponsorship by donating $2,500 or more. With Gold Level Sponsorship, one receives an introduction when we are in competitions.
