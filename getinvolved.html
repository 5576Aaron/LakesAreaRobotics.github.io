                            and events to show off our robot and teach kids about STEM.

                            and also run an educational robotics camp for kids 4th-6th grade.

                            We would not be able to function without the generous donations and support of our sponsors.
                            They have helped to inspire futures in STEM careers and spread awareness about STEM in our community.
                            We thank them all for their generous support.
