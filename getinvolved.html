                        <p>
                            If you are unable to directly support Team 5576, volunteering with FIRST is another great opportunity.
                            Alumni, parents, and anyone interested in STEM are all encouraged to volunteer at FIRST events.

                            <p>Even if you are not able to volunteer your time, you can still help inspire our students!
                                It takes a lot of funding to run our program. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, so all donations are tax deductible.</p>
