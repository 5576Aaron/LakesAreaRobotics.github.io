                    We are the Iowa City Robotics Team 167, otherwise known as the Children of the Corn.
                    Our team was formed in 1998 and is composed of students ninth through twelfth grade from Iowa City area high schools.
                    There are about 40 members of our team and we welcome all kinds of students.
                    We are part of the First Robotics Challenge, and we have participated in multiple competitions in the past.
                    In 2016, we participated in 2 competitions and got to the quarterfinals in one and the semifinals in the other.
                    In 2015, we participated in two competitions and made it to the playoffs in both.
                    We work hard to extend the FIRST motto of gracious professionalism and teach valuable STEM skills to each student that joins the team.
